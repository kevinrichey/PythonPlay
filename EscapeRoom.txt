
How to Play Escape Room Game in Python
========================================

## Run

Requires Python 3.6.

Command Line:

> python EscapeRoom.py

## Setup

You are trapped in a room. There are **fixtures** to interact with, **items** to pickup.

Find a way to get out of the room.

## Rules

Use one and two word commands.

Single-word commands:

 - **status** - See your inventory and list of available fixtures.
 - **quit** - End the game early.

Interact with fixtures in the room with two-word "action subject" commands. Here are some common commands:

 - **inspect** - Look closely at the fixture. Example: "inspect room"
 - **open** - Open a closed fixture. Example: "open drawer"
 - **close** - Close a fixture. Example: "close safe"

Inspecting a fixture may reveal new fixtures or items. You cannot interact with a fixture until you discover it through inspection. 
For example, you cannot jump ahead and type "open drawer" before you have inspected the desk.

Finding an item will automatically add it to you inventory.

Using items is automatic. You just need to have the item in your possession for it to work. 
If you have the correct item in your possession 
When you interact with a fixture that requires an item and you have that item in your inventory,
the fixture command will just use the item. 
For example, if you have the code, then you will automatically use the code when you type "open safe". 

The game will end when you find the escape.

There are no dead-ends, killing moves, or failure options.
